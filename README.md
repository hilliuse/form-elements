form-elements
============

Just some [LESS](http://lesscss.org/ "LESS &laquo; The Dynamic Stylesheet language") code I use repeatedly to style forms on websites.
Sticking it here to speed things up slightly - especially the button code.
If you like it and you use [LESS](http://lesscss.org/ "LESS &laquo; The Dynamic Stylesheet language") feel free to use it.
